Dependencies: #TODO maybe turn into ansible playbook or shell script?
    - sqlite3 (sqldiff)
    - for Mac OS X: coreutils (for greadlink -F)
        brew install coreutils

TODO:
    - method for "applying" git-sqlite to an existing repository
        - smuggle .gitconfig kv-pairs into repo
        - cross platform way of getting sqldiff
    - detecting diffed triggers & views
    - `git-show` cmd (currently using `git-show-sql` alias but sqlite-diff doesn't know the right params)
    - new columns from alter table dont have explicit types (low priority)
