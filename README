Dependencies: #TODO maybe turn into ansible playbook or shell script?
    - sqlite3 (sqldiff)
    - for Mac OS X: coreutils (for greadlink -F)
        brew install coreutils

TODO:
    - smuggle .gitconfig kv-pairs into repo
    - add git diff headers
    - cross platform way of getting sqldiff (doesn't seem to be in debian binary repo)
