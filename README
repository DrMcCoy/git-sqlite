Dependencies:
    - sqlite3
    - sqldiff
    - bash
    - perl
    - git

sqldiff is included in the sqlite source code,
it needs to be compiled from the sqlite source code,
and installed in the user path.

A basic example is below, see `INSTALLING SQLDIFF`

INSTALLING SQLDIFF
==================

```
wget https://www.sqlite.org/src/tarball/sqlite.tar.gz?r=release
tar xzf sqlite.tar.gz?r=release
cd sqlite
./configure
make sqldiff
sudo install sqldiff /usr/local/bin/
```

See https://www.sqlite.org/download.html for more information

TODO
====
    - detect when two or more fields change on one record during git conflict
    - detect when two or more records change during git conflict
    - detecting diffed triggers & views (maybe should be handled in sqldiff upstream)
    - new columns from alter table dont have explicit types
    - uuid version 1 style
